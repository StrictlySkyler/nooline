  "readme": "# Gitty\n\nGitty is a Node.js wrapper for the Git CLI. It's syntax closely resembles the Git command line syntax to asynchronously execute common commands, and parses the output into operable objects - depending on the call.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* Node.js 0.8.x (http://nodejs.org)\n* Git 1.7.x.x (http://git-scm.com)\n* Mac OSX or Linux-based System\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ npm install gitty\n```\n\n**Note**: If you encounter an error during installation on Mac OSX, make sure you have the XCode Command Line Tools installed. Gitty depends on **pty.js** for authenticated operations - which requires GCC compiler.\n\n1. Go to the App store and download the latest version of Xcode for free.\n2. Install Xcode (the app store actually downloads the \"installer\" for Xcode)\n3. Start Xcode\n4. Go to Preferences\n5. Go to Downloads\n6. Click on the \"install\" button after \"Command Line Tools\"\n7. Reboot\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, require Gitty.\n\n```javascript\nvar git = require('gitty');\n```\n\nThe \"meat\" of the functionality is encapsulated in instances of a `Repository` object. This object is instantiated with the path to the repository you wish to perform actions on.\n\n```javascript\nvar myRepo = git('/path/to/repo');\n// sugar for --> new git.Repository('/path/to/repo');\n```\n\nNow you can call this instance of `Repository`'s methods. For example, to execute `git log` for `myRepo`, you would do:\n\n```javascript\nmyRepo.log(function(err, log) {\n\tif (err) {\n\t\t// handle error\n\t} else {\n\t\t// do something with `log`\t\n\t}\n});\n```\n\nA complete list of the available methods is below, as well as other Gitty functions.\n\n## Potential Use Cases\n\n* Writing an exception logger with more insight\n* Building a web based Git client\n* Integrating automated deployments\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Repository(path)\n\nCreates an instance of `gitty.Repository` from the given `path`. Each instance contains the following properties and has access to the following methods.\n\n#### Repository.graph(callback) - **NEW IN 1.2.1!!!**\n\nPasses a 2-dimensional array to the callback containing data that can be consumed by a UI for generating a network graph\n\n**callback**\n* Type: `Function`\n* Description: Receives argument(s): `(err, graph_data)`\n\n#### Repository.isRepository\n\n**Type**: `Boolean`\n\nBased on the existence of the `.git/` directory under the instance `path`.\n\n#### Repository.name\n\n**Type**: `String`\n\nDirectory name of the instantiated `Repository`.\n\n#### Repository.path\n\n**Type**: `String`\n\nNormalized copy of the instance `path`.\n\n#### Repository.init(callback, flags)\n\nInitializes the directory as a Git repository.\n\n**callback**\n* Type: `Function`\n* Description: Receives argument(s): `(err)`\n\n**flags**\n* Type: `Array`\n* Description: Command flags like `['--bare','--shared']`\n\n#### Repository.log(callback, useSync)\n\nPasses commit history as array to callback.

This is constructor is used primarily internally, for executing `Repository` methods, however, it is exposed - see *Extending Gitty*. Each instance contains the following properties and has access to the following methods.\n\n#### Command.repo\n\n**Type**: `String`\n\nDirectory path for the instantiated `Command` object\n\n#### Command.command\n\n**Type**: `String`\n\nAssembled command string based on the instantiated `operation`, `flags`, and `options`\n\n#### Command.exec(callback)\n\nExecutes a `child_process` by the instance's `command` property in the directory specified by the instance's `path` property\n\n**callback**\n* Type: `Function`\n* Description: Receives argument(s): `(err, stdout, stderr)`\n\n> **Note:** This is a wrapper for Node's `child_process.exec` that, first, validates the path as a Git repository before execution. If the path fails validation, an `Error` will be thrown.\n\n### config(key, value, callback)\n\nDoes global Git configuration\n\n**key**\n* Type: `String`\n* Description: Name of configuration property to set\n\n**value**\n* Type: `String`\n* Description: Value to set to the named configuration property\n\n**callback** (optional)\n* Type: `Function`\n* Description: Receives argument(s): `(err)`\n\n### clone(path, url, callback, creds)\n\nClones the repository at `url` into the specified `path`\n\n**path**\n* Type: `String`\n* Description: Path to directory to clone into\n\n**url**\n* Type: `String`\n* Description: Url of the Git repository to clone\n\n**callback**\n* Type: `Function`\n* Description: Receives argument(s): `(err, success)`\n\n**creds** (optional)\n* Type: `Object`\n* Description: Formatted as `{ user : 'username', pass : 'password' }`\n\n> **Note:** This method does not use an instance of `Command()`, see *Authenticated Repositories*\n\n## Authenticated Repositories\n\nOne challenge that was faced while developing Gitty was performing any authenticated operations. Since OpenSSH does not read input from `stdin` for authentication, but rather a psuedo-terminal - Gitty uses *pty.js* (<https://github.com/chjj/pty.js/>) to spawn a pseudo-terminal for operations that may require authentication, such as `pull`, `push`, and `clone`.\n\nCredentials are always passed as the last argument and are optional. Below is an example of an authenticated `Repository.push()`.\n\n```javascript\n// do authenticated push to origin\nmyRepo.push('origin', 'master', function(err, succ) {\n\tif (err) {\n\t\tconsole.log(err);\n\t} else {\n\t\tconsole.log(succ);\n\t}\n}, {\n\tuser : 'username',\n\tpass : 'password'\n});\n```\n\nThis format is consistent for all authenticated operations. Keep this in mind if you are extending Gitty with an operation that requires authentication, and be sure to read the pty.js documentation.\n\n## Extending Gitty\n\nAlmost all of the `Repository` methods are simply convenience wrappers around instances of `Command`. This makes extending the `Repository` constructor with custom methods easy as pie! Let's run through a quick example. Let's say we want to add a method for creating a new branch and automatically switching to it. What do we need to do?\n\n1. Extend the `Repository` prototype\n2. Create a new instance of `Command`\n3. Parse the output and pass to a callback\n\nThree steps is all it should take to add a new method to the `Repository` constructor, and below is how you might do it.\n\n```javascript\n// require gitty\nvar git = require('gitty');\n\n// create new prototype endpoint\n// we want to pass a branch name and callback into this method\ngit.Repository.prototype.branchAndCheckout = function(name, callback) {\n\n\t// save the scope of the repository\n\tvar repo = this\n\t// create a new instance of Command\n\t  , cmd = new git.Command(repo.path, 'checkout', ['-b'], name);\n\t  \n\t// execute the command and determine the outcome\n\tcmd.exec(function(error, stdout, stderr) {\n\t\tvar err = error || stderr;\n\t\t\n\t\t// call the callback function in the repository scope\n\t\t// passing it err and stdout\n\t\tcallback.call(repo, err, stdout);\n\t});\n};\n```\n\nIt's a simple as that. Now you would be able to use this custom method in your application, like so:\n\n```javascript\nmyRepo.branchAndCheckout('myBranch', function(err, data) {\n\tif (err) {\n\t\t// throw error\n\t} else {\n\t\tconsole.log(data);\n\t}\n});\n```\n\n## The Output Parser\n\nThe output parser is simply a collection of functions that accept the string output of an executed command, and turn it into something that can be operated on. For example, the output from `git log` gets converted to an array of object-literals before being returned back to the callback for `Repository.log()`. \n\n## Contributing\n\nOne of the reasons I have tried to make Gitty so easy to extend is, well, because I want you to extend it! It is not a wrapper for every possible Git operation, but it most certainly could be, and with minimal coding too! Contributions are always welcome and encouraged. However, to keep Gitty clean and healthy, before making additions consider the following:\n\n1. Does my addition follow the conventions already in place?\n2. Does my code belong where I have placed it?\n3. Does my syntax resemble the Git CLI?\n\nIf you can answer \"yes\" to these 3 questions, then send a pull request!\n\n## Author\nGitty was written by Gordon Hall (gordon@gordonwritescode.com)  \nLicensed under MIT license",
