It's cool though â€“ proof of concept, and now I have an entire CMS running on node.js. That's a win.</p><p>More to come. I'd like to get <a href=\"http://calip.so\">Calipso</a> up and running, as it looks like a more robust platform, but it relies upon an older version of node. So, we'll see.</p>"
