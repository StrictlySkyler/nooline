In my opinion, neither is close to being true right now.</p>\n\n<p>This quest of mine has led me through the deepest, darkest parts the tech world, from Systems Administration to Enterprise Architecture, and has landed me squarely at the understanding that the only way to achieve the level of consistent, easy User Experience I want is make it ubiquitous on the Web.</p>\n\n<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that JavaScript will be the next C, and I'd like to make sure we get it right this time around.</p>"
